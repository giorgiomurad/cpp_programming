// Problem taken from Introduction to Java Programming by Y. Daniel Liang (8th ed.)
// Inheritance and Polymorphism
//
// Problem 11.5 : Define the class Course with the usage of an ArrayList to store students.
//                The Course class should include the following methods:
//                      - Course([courseName]) which initializes a new course object with the given course name
//                      - getCourseName() which returns the name of the course
//                      - addStudent([name]) which adds the name of the student to the course
//                      - dropStudent([name]) which drops the student from the course
//                      - getStudents() which returns the array or list of students enrolled in the course
//                      - getNbOfStudents() which returns the number of students enrolled in the course
